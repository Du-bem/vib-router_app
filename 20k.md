# Assumptions
    
* Traffic: Assume 20,000 monthly active users with peak traffic of 200 visits/hour and 60 transactions/hour during a 12-hour daily window.
* Frontend: JavaScript-based static content served via Amazon CloudFront and S3.
* Backend: Python-based API hosted on ECS with AWS Fargate.
* Database: Relational database hosted on Amazon RDS (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL).
* Storage: Static files stored in Amazon S3.
* High Availability: Multi-AZ setup for the database and ECS containers.
* Monitoring & Security: AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and AWS WAF for security.

# Cost Estimation Breakdown

## Amazon Route 53
DNS Hosting: $0.50/month per hosted zone.

DNS Queries: Assume ~1 million queries/month = $0.40.

Total Route 53 Cost: ~$1/month.

## Amazon CloudFront
Assume 10 GB of static content served per day (~300 GB/month).

Data transfer cost: $0.085/GB for the first 10 TB = ~$25.50/month.

HTTP/HTTPS requests: Assume ~1 million requests/month = ~$7.50.

Total CloudFront Cost: ~$33/month.

## Application Load Balancer (ALB)
ALB hourly rate: $0.0225/hour × 730 hours = ~$16.43/month.

LCU usage (based on traffic): ~$10/month.

Total ALB Cost: ~$26/month.

## Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate
Assume 2 vCPUs and 4 GB memory per container instance.

Task runtime: Continuous operation with two containers (frontend and backend).

vCPU charges: $0.0000089944/vCPU-second × ~5 million seconds = ~$45/month.

Memory charges: $0.0000009889/GB-second × ~10 million seconds = ~$10/month.

Total ECS Cost: ~$55/month.

## Amazon RDS
Instance type: db.t3.medium (2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM).

Compute cost: $0.0416/hour × 730 hours = ~$30/month.

Storage cost: Assume 100 GB of SSD storage = $10/month.

Backup storage (free up to provisioned size): Included.

Total RDS Cost: ~$40/month.

## Amazon S3
Storage cost for static assets (~100 GB): $0.023/GB × 100 GB = ~$2.30/month.

Requests (PUT/COPY/GET): Assume ~1 million requests = ~$5.

Total S3 Cost: ~$7/month.

## AWS WAF
Basic plan with up to 50 rules: $2/hour × 730 hours = ~$48/month.

## Amazon CloudWatch
Metrics monitoring (~15 metrics): $0.30/metric-month × 15 metrics = ~$4.50.

Log ingestion (~10 GB): $0.50/GB × 10 GB = ~$5.

Total CloudWatch Cost: ~$10/month.
