# Assumptions
* Traffic: Assume 100,000 monthly active users with peak traffic of 1,000 visits/hour and 300 transactions/hour during a 12-hour daily window.

* Frontend: JavaScript-based static content served via Amazon CloudFront and S3.

* Backend: Python-based API hosted on ECS with AWS Fargate.

* Database: Relational database hosted on Amazon RDS (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL).

* Storage: Static files stored in Amazon S3.

* High Availability: Multi-AZ setup for the database and ECS containers.

* Monitoring & Security: AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and AWS WAF for security.

# Cost Estimation Breakdown
## Amazon Route 53
DNS Hosting: $0.50/month per hosted zone.

DNS Queries: Assume ~5 million queries/month = $2.

Total Route 53 Cost: ~$2.50/month.

## Amazon CloudFront
Assume 50 GB of static content served per day (~1.5 TB/month).

Data transfer cost: $0.085/GB for the first 10 TB = ~$127.50/month.

HTTP/HTTPS requests: Assume ~5 million requests/month = ~$37.50.

Total CloudFront Cost: ~$165/month.

## Application Load Balancer (ALB)
ALB hourly rate: $0.0225/hour × 730 hours = ~$16.43/month.

LCU usage (based on traffic): ~$30/month.

Total ALB Cost: ~$46/month.

## Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate
Assume 4 vCPUs and 8 GB memory per container instance.

Task runtime: Continuous operation with two containers (frontend and backend).

vCPU charges: $0.0000089944/vCPU-second × ~10 million seconds = ~$90/month.

Memory charges: $0.0000009889/GB-second × ~20 million seconds = ~$20/month.

Total ECS Cost: ~$110/month.

## Amazon RDS
Instance type: db.t3.large (2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM).

Compute cost: $0.0832/hour × 730 hours = ~$60/month.

Storage cost: Assume 200 GB of SSD storage = $20/month.

Backup storage (free up to provisioned size): Included.

Total RDS Cost: ~$80/month.

## Amazon S3
Storage cost for static assets (~200 GB): $0.023/GB × 200 GB = ~$4.60/month.

Requests (PUT/COPY/GET): Assume ~5 million requests = ~$25.

Total S3 Cost: ~$30/month.

## AWS WAF
Basic plan with up to 50 rules:

$2/hour × 730 hours = ~$48/month.

## Amazon CloudWatch
Metrics monitoring (~30 metrics): $0.30/metric-month × 30 metrics = ~$9.

Log ingestion (~50 GB): $0.50/GB × 50 GB = ~$25.

Total CloudWatch Cost: ~$34/month.
